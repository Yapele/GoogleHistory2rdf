This project contains 3 files and a folder defining the ontology used to describe the triples

* GoogleHistoryDownloader.py:
	The program works only if you have turned on the Google History service to keep your Google search record.
	It will download all the history search from Google in rss 2.0 format and saves the file to out folder you specify
	- The program does not detect the earliest search history record each user has on Google, the user has to specify the specific
	  starting date to download
	- For first time use, please find the earliest date of your Google search entry at : https://www.google.com/history/
	
	e.g. Signed in with Google id/passwd and click on the "Oldest" link at the button of the page, 
	Google will take you to the earliest date. Say it's 2006 Jan 05
	
	User this date to run the program with "python GoogleHistoryDownloader -u yourid -p yourpasswd --start 20060105"
	
* rss2rdf.py
	Use this program to turn all search history from Google(originally in rss2.0 format) to triples (in N3 format).
	e.g. python rss2rdf -o data/ -f googlerss/
	use "-o" to specify the output folder
	    "-f" to specify the input folder of the files
	    
* sqlite2rdf.py
	This program turns Firefox browse history into rdf format
	
* /ns
  This folder has ontology definition for browsing history in Firefox (stored at places.sqlite db). 
  For detail information about what's in Firefox places.sqlite file, plase visit http://www.firefoxforensics.com/
  - /ns/browser-hitory.n3 
  - /ns/browser-behavior.n3
  
  These two files map to table named 'moz_historyvisits' in places.sqlite . The browser-history maps to most of the columns in table 
  moz_historyvisits. The browser-behavior.n3 maps to column named 'visit_type'in table moz_historyvisits. 
  
  - /ns/browser-place.n3
  This file maps to table named 'moz_places' in places.sqlite . 
  
  - /ns/search-hisotry.n3
  
  This file gives the definition of Google search history. Similar to those in the RSS output from Google history service with slight 
  modification.
